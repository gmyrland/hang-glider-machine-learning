# Exploratory Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the exploratory analysis is to begin looking at flight data to identify useful characteristics, trends, and identify any useful properties or possibilities for features.
This involves developing tools for reading, inspecting, and manipulating the raw data files.

## The Data

The initial data set is the vario output of collection of 55 of my flights.
You can find information and videos of most of these flights at my [hang gliding website](https://hg.gmyrland.com/).

The flights occurred at two locations in southern Ontario, Canada.

### File Format

The vario I used outputs flight data in two formats, [IGC](https://filext.com/file-extension/IGC) and [kmz](https://filext.com/file-extension/KMZ).
The files primarily encode:

- Time
- Position (lat / long)
- Altitude

## Analysis

The combined flight paths for both flight fields are shown in the following figures.
